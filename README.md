_**What exactly is a design pattern in software engineering??**_

Well, a design pattern, in the context of software engineering, is a proven and reusable solution to a recurring problem encountered during the design and implementation of software systems. It provides a template for solving a specific type of problem within a particular context, offering a structured approach to software design that promotes flexibility, scalability, and maintainability.

_**DESIGN PATTERNS COVERED**_

 1. Withdraw-pattern
 2. Access restriction pattern
 3. Emergency stop pattern
 4. Factory creation pattern
 5. Iterable map pattern

**Note:**
**There are many design patterns. These are just a few of them discussed in this work of mine..**

_**Let me hope this helped**_
