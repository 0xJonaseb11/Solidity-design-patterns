# About

**The withdrawal pattern is also referred as a pull-over-push pattern. This pattern allows ether or token to be removed from a contract by pull instead of push.**

A smart contract can contain ether and you might want to distribute the ether to different account. It is better you allow the owner of the ether or token pull it themselves instead of pushing the ether to their address.

**Note:**

_**When to use the withdrawal pattern**_

- You are sending ether/token to multiple accounts
- You want to avoid paying transaction fee as the initiator of the transaction pays the fees.
