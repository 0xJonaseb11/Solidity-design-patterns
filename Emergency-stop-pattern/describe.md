## About
#### This pattern incorporates the ability to pause all functions execution in the contract in the case of something going wrong. Since contracts are immutable once deployed; if there are bugs in the contract the `pause` functionality can be activated to prevent further damage caused.

#### The emergency pause functionality should be in the control of the owner or an authorised address. The `Emergency stop pattern` should be avoided at all means as it is against the spirit of decentralisation but in those instance where a centralized control is required, it could be a worthy pattern to incorporate in your contract.
